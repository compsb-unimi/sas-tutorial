# Tutorial 2:<br> Generating a conformational ensemble with GMX and hySAS
The main purpose of hySAS is to allow an MD engine, independently of the force field, to generate a conformational ensemble that is in agreement with the experimental data. To achieve this, a potential is added to the system to discourage conformations that do not match the measured signal. Here, we propose two examples of coupling methods to introduce this energy penalty during the MD simulation.

Most of the SAS options have been discussed in Tutorial 1, here we present two additional flags: EXPINT and SCALE_EXPINT. For each QVALUE is required an EXPINT value, which consists in the experimental intensity measured at that specific momentum transfer. All the EXPINT values must be rescaled to the SAXS intensity at q = 0. To facilitate this operation, it is possible to automatically rescale all the experimental intensity entries with SCALE_EXPINT, which allows to provide the intensity at q = 0. In this way, each EXPINT is divided by SCALE_EXPINT.

In general, the more the q-values and the corresponding experimental intensities, the more intensive the calculation.

#### HARMONIC / LINEAR RESTRAINT

In this example, the SAXS profile is calculated using the ONEBEAD mapping, specifying a solvent electron density of 334 electrons/nm<sup>3</sup> and a correction of 80 electrons/nm<sup>3</sup> for the beads exposed to the solvent. The solvent-accessible surface calculation, which is required to assess the beads' exposure to the solvent, is performed every 10 steps of the simulation. The theoretical intensity at q = 0 is defined by SCALE_EXPINT, while the experimentally determined intensity for a given QVALUE is reported by EXPINT. All the EXPINT values are rescaled by the SCALE_EXPINT value.

The STATS action is then used to calculate statistical properties between the intensities computed from the coordinates of the simulated system for each QVALUE and the corresponding experimental references defined with EXPINT. Specifically, the correlation between the *in silico* intensities and the experimental intensities is considered as an argument for RESTRAINT, an action from the BIAS module. As additional information useful to follow the evolution of the simulation, the radius of gyration of the system is printed every 100 steps. 

Detailed information on STATS, RESTRAINT and GYRATION can be found in the PLUMED manual.

#### METAINFERENCE
Changing the coupling method does not affect the main SAXS/SANS actions, which remain unchanged. In this example we use metainference, a Bayesian replica-averaging framework that restrain the average predicted data, in this case the SAXS signal calculated from the system coordinates, to be close to the experimental observable, generating an ensemble in accordance to the maximum entropy principle. METAINFERENCE is part of the ISDB module, see the PLUMED manual and the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1501177) for full details.

Unlike the previous example, we do not use the SCALE_EXPINT flag because the EXPINT values have already been rescaled. In both the examples the maximum momentum transfer accepted for the ONEBEAD mapping is 0.3 Ã…<sup>-1</sup>.
